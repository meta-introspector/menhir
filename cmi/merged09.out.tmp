main: INT TIMES TIMES

## Ends in an error in state: 5.

## expr -> expr TIMES . expr [ TIMES RPAREN PLUS MINUS EOF DIV ]

## The known suffix of the stack is as follows:

After a multiplication operator, an expression is expected.

main: INT RPAREN
##
## Ends in an error in state: 16.
##
## expr -> expr . PLUS expr [ TIMES PLUS MINUS EOF DIV ]
## expr -> expr . MINUS expr [ TIMES PLUS MINUS EOF DIV ]
## expr -> expr . TIMES expr [ TIMES PLUS MINUS EOF DIV ]
## expr -> expr . DIV expr [ TIMES PLUS MINUS EOF DIV ]
## main -> expr . EOF [ # ]
##
## The known suffix of the stack is as follows:
## expr

I have read the expression '$0'.
I am now expecting either an arithmetic operator or the end of the input.
